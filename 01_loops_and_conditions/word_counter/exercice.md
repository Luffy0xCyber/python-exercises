# Exercise: Word Counter

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `number_of_words.py`.
2. **Part 1:** Write a program that counts words assuming they are separated by a single space.
3. **Part 2 (Elaborate version):** Improve the program to consider a "word" as an uninterrupted sequence of letters.
   * Words can be separated by any non-letter character (spaces, punctuation, symbols).
   * **Tip:** Use the `.isalpha()` function to check if a character is a letter.
4. Display the result in the exact format shown in the example.
