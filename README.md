# Python Exercises

This repository contains my Python practice code. I use it to improve my skills and document my solutions to different problems.

## Structure

I organized the repository by topic. Inside each folder, you will usually find these three files:

* **exercise.md**: This explains the problem or the task to do.
* **script.py**: This is the Python code with the solution.
* **analysis.md**: I include this file when the code needs more explanation. It covers how the logic works or why I chose a specific approach.

## Topics Covered

The exercises focus on these main concepts:

* Loops and conditions
* Lists and tuples
* Unit testing
* File handling and Regex

## How to use

You can browse the folders to see the code. To run a solution, navigate to the specific folder in your terminal and run the Python file.
