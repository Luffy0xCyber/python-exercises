# Python Exercises

This repository contains my Python practice code. I use it to improve my skills and document my solutions to different problems.

## Structure

I organized the repository by topic. Inside each folder, you will usually find these three files:

* **exercise.md**: This explains the problem or the task to do.
* **script.py**: This is the Python code with the solution.
* **analysis.md**: I include this file when the code needs more explanation. It covers how the logic works or why I chose a specific approach.

## Topics Covered

The exercises focus on these main concepts:

* Loops and conditions
* Lists and tuples
* Unit testing
* File handling and Regex

## How to use

You can browse the folders to see the code. To run a solution, navigate to the specific folder in your terminal and run the Python file.

# Note

Please be aware that some exercises are basic and don't reflect my current skill level. They are part of my learning journey. Also, sometimes the teacher asks us to follow specific instructions.

Furthermore, a majority of the exercises were created by my teachers, **M. François Schumacker** and **Mme. Marianne Collet**. The solutions are my own work as a student.
